      <p>
        This is a Choose Your Own Adventure game. If you have not heard of this
        type of story before, it is essentially an interactive book. The main
        character of the book is <em>you!!</em> As you read through the story,
        you will be given choices to make. Each choice directs you to another
        page (not necessarily in order!) and changes the path the story takes.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will want a place to take notes, to keep track of things such as
        your health, inventory, and important notes. Like the physical books,
        this story will *not* do so for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many choices that will ultimately lead to your demise - fear
        not! You can always start the story over and try again! There is only
        <em>one</em> "good" ending. Will you find it?
      </p>
      <p>
        New chapters will be released periodically - keep an eye on this page
        for the latest updates!
