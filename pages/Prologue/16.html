        Despite the late hour, you head out to investigate the sparkle that has
        invaded your every thought. Passing by your car, you briefly consider
        attempting to start it again - but there is no time! You know you must
        hurry to get to the courtyard! You pull out your phone to call a cab,
        when someone shouts your name.
      </p>
      <p>Looking up, you see your neighbour Lucas.</p>
      <p>"Hey, you heading somewhere?" he asks.</p>
      <p>
        You explain that you are heading to the office, and he tells you he also
        has some work to do. Lucas offers you a ride, which you gratefully
        accept, and the two of you make your way to the office building.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you arrive, you step out of the car and head toward the main
        entrance. The sparkle in the courtyard is still there, and it catches
        your eye quickly under the night sky. Lucas does not seem to even notice
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        "You coming?" He is standing there impatiently, waiting for your
        response. You tell him to go on in, and let him know you'll be right
        behind him. He gives you a strange look before taking off.
      </p>
      <p>
        You walk down the gravel path - the courtyard has a very different
        environment at night. You finally reach the back corner, where you first
        noticed the strange light come from. Looking around, you do not notice
        anything unusual - until you spot a bright blue crystal on the ground.
        You pick it up, looking it over. It appears to give off a bright light.
        <em
          >Could this be the source of that sparkle? How has no one noticed this
          yet?</em
        >
        You continue to inspect the crystal, finally noticing some strange words
        etched into the bottom surface.
