        You decide it would be best to just head home. Work has left you
        drained, and you cannot handle the idea of being at the office any
        longer, not even in the courtyard.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you head to the parking lot, you see the sparkle in the courtyard
        again. <em>I am far too tired to deal with this right now,</em> you tell
        yourself. You walk all the way to your usual parking space before
        remembering that your car would not start. With a sigh, you pull you
        phone out and dial the number for the cab company.
      </p>
      <p>
        The dispatcher informs you that the driver will pick you up in front of
        the main entrance, and you make your way back. While you wait for the
        cab to arrive, the sparkle catches your eye yet again. Before you
        finally consider giving up and going to take another look, your cab
        arrives at last.
