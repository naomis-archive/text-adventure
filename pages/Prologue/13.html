        You realise you have nothing on you to eat, and you would hate to walk
        away from this and risk losing the crystal entirely. So you push aside
        the hunger and continue focusing on the words, trying to determine how
        each one should be pronounced.
      </p>
      <p>
        After you puzzle out the last word, you begin to wonder - is this an
        incantation? You have never been a strong believer in magic, but you
        cannot shake the feeling that this is <em>actually</em> a magic spell.
        The best way to find out, of course, is by trying it out!
      </p>
      <p>
        You begin to speak the words on the bottom of the crystal, hoping your
        assumptions about the pronunciations are correct. As you speak each
        word, you feel a strange energy emanating from the crystal - it grows
        stronger and stronger with each word you speak.
      </p>
      <p>
        You start to realise that something seems off. The energy feels
        dangerous, perhaps even malicious. Could your hunger have caused you to
        mispronounce a word? You try to stop speaking, to prevent this from
        getting out of hand, but you have no control over yourself. Your body is
        chanting the words autonomously. As you speak the last word, the crystal
        glows brightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The energy within the crystal violently explodes, throwing you away from
        it. The last thing you feel is the back of your head cracking against
        the wall of the office building - then, your consciousness fades away.
