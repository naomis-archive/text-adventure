        After a short time that seemed much longer than it was, you arrive home
        at last. You thank the driver, exit the cab, and walk up the driveway.
        Your poor broken-down car catches your attention briefly, but you are
        too tired to worry about it now, so you decide to head inside.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moment you walk in to the house you realise just how hungry you are.
        <em>Maybe I should have stopped for dinner...</em> You head over to the
        refrigerator and poke around for a bit, finding some leftover sushi.
        Hoping it is still good, you sit down and eat it.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you eat, you still find yourself distracted. No matter how hard you
        try, you cannot stop thinking about that sparkle in the courtyard. A
        glance at the clock reveals it has gotten rather late, but should you
        head back?
