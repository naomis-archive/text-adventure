        Switching the alarm off for the day, you force yourself out of bed - an
        agonising process. Your sleep last night was plagued with strange
        dreams, and you cannot help but feel that something is different about
        today. A sense of impending doom clouds your thoughts.
      </p>

        You make your way to the kitchen and switch on the coffee maker. The
        aroma revitalises you, and as your cup fills with the glorious elixir
        you remember that you worked late last night. The hunger hits you - you
        missed out on dinner because you were at the office finishing some code
        for the latest request from the client.
      </p>

        Thankfully, you decided not to hit the snooze button today. For the
        first time in a few weeks, you actually have the chance to make yourself
        a real breakfast, instead of grabbing a snack and heading out the door.
        As you drink your coffee, you consider whether you should take the time
        to fix a full meal.
