        You know you cannot afford the rather exorbitant cost of calling a cab,
        so you decide to try your hand at fixing it yourself. First, though, you
        give your boss a call to let her know the situation. You pull out your
        phone and punch her number in on the keypad - you really need to get
        around to buying a proper smart phone one of these days.

        <em>RING RING RING</em> - The sound of the line ringing on the other end
        is jarring. <em>RING RING RING</em> - Strange, usually your boss is
        quick to answer her phone. A couple more rings and you end up reaching
        her voicemail box - you leave a message explaining the situation.

        After putting your phone away, you roll up your sleeves and prepare for

        what you are looking at. Why did you think this was a good idea?

        <em>BUZZ BUZZ!</em> The vibration of your phone in your pocket
        interrupts your train of thought. You pull out the phone - the boss is
        calling you back. Of course you answer; though you quickly regret it. A
        few minutes of yelling and frustration (from your boss - you could never
        work up the courage to yell back) and you are now out of a job. Closing
        the hood of your car, you head back inside - an increasingly intense
        sinking feeling building in your chest. You have no idea what you will
        do now - without your job, you'll end up losing everything...
