        You awaken to the sound of your alarm going off. It is an
        all-too-familiar sound, which interrupts your blissful sleep each
        morning to force you into another day of drudgery at the office.
      </p>
      <p><em>BEEP BEEP BEEP!</em></p>
      <p>
        The sound cuts through your thoughts, and you start to shake the fog
        from your head. You slowly roll over to face the alarm clock and reach
        to turn it off... Then the thought crosses your mind. You could hit the
        snooze button instead, and catch a few more winks of sleep. What will
        you do?
