        The cab ride home is silent; the driver can clearly tell you are lost in
        thought. As he drives you home, you stare out the window absentmindedly,
        still fixated on the strange occurrence in the courtyard.
        <em
          >What was that thing? Why was it there? Did no one else really notice
          it?</em
        >
        The thoughts continue to haunt you, until interrupted by a gurgling in
        your stomach.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment, you realise how hungry you are. Another day of working
        through your lunch has left you famished. You glance out the window to
        take note of your surroundings.
        <em
          >Good, we are still in the city. Should I have the driver take me to
          get food?</em
