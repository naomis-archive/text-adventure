        It has been long enough since your last meal that you decide not to
        wait. Besides, it is rare that you have this opportunity, so you might
        as well take it! Finishing your first cup of coffee, you start brewing
        another one before turning to the refrigerator.
      </p>
      <p>
        You grab some eggs and sausage and begin cooking. The smell is
        absolutely overwhelming, and you feel the gnawing hunger in your stomach
        becoming stronger and stronger. After an agonising few minutes, the food
        is finally done. You grab your second cup of coffee and your food and
        sit down at the table to eat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking advantage of the extra time you have, and the first home-cooked
        meal you've enjoyed in a while, you savour the experience. Each bite of
        food is pure heaven, and you cannot help but feel a tinge of sadness
        when you take the last bite. Cleaning up your dishes, you get ready to
        head out the door and off to work.
