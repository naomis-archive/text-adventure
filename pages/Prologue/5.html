        You resolve yourself to take another look at the courtyard. Heading down
        the gravel path, you think you might have done this already today. But
        for some strange reason, that memory seems to be faded, as if it might
        not have happened at all. <em>What is going on with me today?</em> You
        continue down the path, taking in the beauty of the courtyard -
        something you have not experienced in quite some time.
      </p>
      <p>
        You finally reach the back corner, where you first noticed the strange
        light come from. Looking around, you do not notice anything unusual -
        until you spot a bright blue crystal on the ground. You pick it up,
        looking it over. It appears to give off a bright light.
        <em
          >Could this be the source of that sparkle? How has no one noticed this
          yet?</em
        >
        You continue to inspect the crystal, noticing some strange words etched
        into the bottom surface.
