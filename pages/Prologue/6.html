        Stifling a yawn, you smash the snooze button and silence the alarm
        before rolling over and drifting off into your dreams. Your dreams take
        a strange turn - filled with monsters, and magic, and a grand adventure.

        greatly enjoying the experience.

        Unfortunately, while you meant to hit the snooze button on the alarm
        clock, you accidentally switched off the alarm for the day. You wake in
        the mid-afternoon and the panic immediately sets in. You check your
        phone: 6 missed calls from your boss. As you ponder the repercussions of
        your oversleeping, and figure out what you need to tackle, there is one
        thought at the back of your mind that you cannot seem to shake...
      </p>
      <p>
        You have this strange feeling you missed the opportunity for the
        adventure of a lifetime.
