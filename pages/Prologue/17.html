        It is far too late to be venturing out of the house. Deciding to stay
        in, you go through your standard evening routine and crawl in to bed.
        You are so exhausted that as soon as your head hits the pillow you are
        out cold.

        You find yourself at the courtyard outside your office building. The

        gravel path, the only concern you have is reaching the sparkle. As you
        bolt down the path and get closer to the location of the sparkle, your
        heart sinks. It is gone. There is no sparkle, there is no evidence it

        Your legs buckle and you collapse to the ground. Was it a dream? Was it
