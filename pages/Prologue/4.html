        You decide to examine the strange sparkle you saw. It could be nothing,
        but maybe someone dropped something valuable! You could always use the
        money - returning it to the owner could yield a significant reward.
      </p>

        Turning away from the main path, you head down the gravel trail through
        the courtyard garden. It has been some time since you last walked this
        trail, and you had forgotten how relaxing it was. Even if the sparkle
        turns out to be nothing, at the least you got a much-needed chance to
        relax.
      </p>

        You finally reach the back corner, where you first noticed the strange
        light come from. Looking around, you do not notice anything unusual -
        until you spot a bright blue crystal on the ground. You pick it up,
        looking it over. It appears to give off a bright light.
        <em
          >Could this be the source of that sparkle? How has no one noticed this
          yet?</em
        >
        You continue to inspect the crystal, finally noticing some strange words
        etched into the bottom surface.
