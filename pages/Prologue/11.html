        Taking a closer look at the engraving, you examine the words closely. As
        you stare at them, they seem to shift and move. The words start to make
        a little more sense, as if they have translated themselves into
        something you can understand. But the sounds are still foreign and
        unfamiliar.
      </p>

        You start to sound out the first word aloud. After a few attempts, you
        get a result that sounds like it might be correct. You move on to the
        second word, starting the process again.

        Your train of thought is derailed by a sudden rumbling sound. Pulling
        your attention away from the crystal, you check your surroundings for
        the source of the noise. Nothing jumps out at you until you hear the
        sound again - and determine it is your stomach! You feel the hunger
        setting in, thanks to working through lunch <em>again</em>, and you
        realise you should eat something before you continue.
