        You wander outside, dreading the thought of going to work again. Your
        car waits for you in the driveway - an old, rundown Honda Accord. It's
        not the fastest, newest, or shiniest car, but it's yours. And it works.
        Well, most of the time...
      </p>
      <p>
        You hop in your car and turn the key to start it. The car makes some
        strange whiny sound but does not start. Muttering under your breath, you
        try starting it again - still no success. Great. Now what?
      </p>
      <p>
        You consider your options: You could try to fix it, though that might
        make you late to work, or you could leave the car behind and call a cab.
        Calling a cab means spending money you should not be spending, but at
        least you would get to work on time.
