        You know you cannot afford to be late to work again, and you do not know
        the first thing about fixing cars. So calling a cab is the only option.
        You pull out your phone and punch the number for the cab company in on
        the keypad - you really need to get around to buying a proper smart
        phone one of these days. A few minutes later, the driver pulls up to
        take you to work.

        Your thoughts wander with no direction as you make the thirty minute
        trip to the office. Staring out the window, you are completely
        distracted - for some reason, today just feels different. The sight of
        your towering office building pulls you back in to reality. The cab
        driver pulls up to the main entrance and stops to let you out. Giving
        him the little bit of cash you had in your wallet, you thank him for the
        ride and walk toward the building.

        Just out of the corner of your eye, you see a strange sparkle.
        <em>What was that? It looks like it came from the courtyard garden?</em>
        It could have been a trick of the eye, the sun hitting something in just
        the right way. But with the way today has been going, it might be worth
        looking at more closely.
