        You head into the office. Sharon, the receptionist, greets you with a
        polite "hello". You give her a wave before making your way to the
        elevator, which is thankfully open. You rush to get to the elevator
        before the doors close, and you make it just in time. What you had not
        realised, however, was that the elevator was also occupied by your boss
        Megan. She begins walking you through the various tasks waiting for you
        to handle, but you find your mind wandering.
      </p>
      <p>
        The workday passes by. You are fairly productive, accomplishing the work
        handed to you by Megan and by your coworkers. But you cannot remember
        much of what you did - instead, all you can think about is that strange
        occurrence in the courtyard. You continue to toy with the idea of taking
        another look - this <em>has</em> to be something important, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        Before you know it your day is over and it is time to head home. You
        take the stairs down to the main floor, avoiding anyone who tries to
        stop for a chat. There is only one thing on your mind right now. Should
        you go take a look at the courtyard again? Or should you just go home?
